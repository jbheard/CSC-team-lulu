## API Example

For the API example you will first need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/installation/#install-flask).

Once you have these installed you can get started, open a terminal (or command prompt/powershell on windows) and `cd` into the "[API Example](/API+Example)" directory. Then run `python api_example.py` and open `http://localhost/` in your browser. I encourage you to read the code in `api_example.py` and try to understand what is happening as you experiment with the site.
